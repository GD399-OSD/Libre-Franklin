TO-Do:

- Achicar Left sidebearing en /a y /c
- /f /t, mover contornos hacia el left side just a bit
- /g ear: make shorter and taller
- Ligaduras, dejar un poco mas de espacio blanco entre los miembros

- Decitions to make:
Caps are bolder than lowercases, as in the metal font.
Most digital version have normalized that.
Should we also normalize them? or do we like the heavy caps?

Process Log:
Notes on the Libre Franklin revival process

Step 1: Importing Artwork
- Tracing from high resolution ATF scan
- Importing Artwork into Glyphs, each letter into his slot.

Step 2: Spacing
- Initial rougth Spacing
- Deciding the general spacing amount, in relation to the intended usage size range (In this case, since Franklin is a quintessential display face, we decided to space for 30px or bigger).
- Setting total advance widths for each glyphs, and visually centering the contours inside the selected width.
- Printing test using the Testing Page “Spacing” tool
- Refining and improving the spacing.

Step 3: Cleaning Artwork outlines
- Testing different degrees of cleaning (Sharp corners vs Rounded corners vs Organic corners)
- Decided not to use crystal-clear sharp corners, nor mecanicaly rounded corners.
- We are going to use eyevaled rounded corners, trying to get a warmer organic feeling (But not too much, just a little bit of it).

Step 4: Optimizations
- Refine the BBox, and set the Vertical metrics
- Rescale to make the most out of BBox
- Review Overshoots for consistency
- Review Stems and counters widths for consistency
- Round Widths and Refine Spacing

Step 5: Uppercase
- Deciding what to do on the Uppercase: Leave it as is (bolder than lowercases) or make it a bit ligther.

Step 6: Completing charset
- Adding all the missing glyphs. Punctuation, diacritics, etc.

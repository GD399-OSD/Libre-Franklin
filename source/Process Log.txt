Process Log:
Notes on the Libre Franklin revival process

Step 1: Importing Artwork
- Tracing from high resolution ATF scan
- Importing Artwork into Glyphs, each letter into his slot.

Step 2: Spacing
- Initial rougth Spacing
- Deciding the general spacing amount, in relation to the intended usage size range.
- Setting total advance widths for each glyphs, and visually centering the contours inside the selected width.
- Printing test using the Testing Page “Spacing” tool
- Refining and improving the spacing.

Step 3: Starting Cleaning Artwork outlines
- Testing different degrees of cleaning (Sharp corners vs Rounded corners vs Organic corners)
- Decided not to use crystal-clear sharp corners, nor mecanicaly rounded corners.
- We are going to use eyevaled rounded corners, trying to get a warmer organic feeling (But not too much, just a little bit of it).

Step 4: 
- Test, refine and set vertical metrics

Step 5: Completing charset
- Adding all the missing glyphs



TO-do:
- Test increasing spacing by approx 15%
